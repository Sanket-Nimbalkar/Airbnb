Welcome to my Airbnb Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! In this project, I have analyzed the Airbnb dataset, which contains around 49,000 observations with 16 columns. This dataset offers a glimpse into the millions of listings provided through Airbnb, and it plays a crucial role in guiding business decisions, understanding customer and host behaviors, enhancing security measures, and more.

Problem Statement
Since its inception in 2008, Airbnb has revolutionized the way people travel and experience the world. As a platform connecting guests with hosts, Airbnb offers a unique and personalized way of exploring new destinations. Today, Airbnb has become a global service recognized and utilized by millions of users worldwide.
The vast amount of data generated by millions of Airbnb listings presents an excellent opportunity for data analysis. This data analysis plays a crucial role in guiding business decisions, enhancing security measures, understanding customer and host behaviors, and implementing innovative services, among many other applications.

Dataset Overview
The dataset used for this project contains approximately 49,000 observations with 16 columns, encompassing a mix of categorical and numeric values. The dataset provides valuable information about listings, including pricing, locations, room types, host details, and more.

Project Objectives
The main objectives of this EDA project are as follows:

Explore the dataset to gain insights into the Airbnb listings' characteristics and trends.
Analyze the distribution of listings across various cities and room types.
Visualize data to present key findings effectively.

Methodology and Tools
I have utilized Python as the primary programming language for this project. The data analysis and visualization were performed using popular Python libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Key Questions Explored
Throughout the analysis, I have explored several key questions, including:

- Which cities have the highest number of Airbnb listings?
- What are the most common room types preferred by guests?
- How does the price of listings vary across different  room types?
- How does the price of listings vary across different cities?
